In React Router Dom v6,  using the `useParams()` hook inside a component that's *not* directly within a route's component tree can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `useParams()` hook relies on the routing context provided by its parent Route components.  If you try to access it outside that context, it'll return an empty object, even if the URL parameters seem correctly set.  This often manifests as missing or incorrect data.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
function MyComponent() {
  const params = useParams(); // params will be {} here
  return <div>ID: {params.id}</div>;
}

function MyRoute() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/:id" element={<MyComponent/>}/>
    </Routes>
  );
}
```
